Allow only string-valued positional arguments and retrieve them from the command-line.

Allow the inclusion of additional descriptive information on the program and each 
argument and provide named "-h" argument that shows usage and help information by default.

Allow datatype information to be added to arguments so that non-string arguments can be used (int, float, boolean, string).

Allow named arguments with single values, which may have help and datatype information, after all positional arguments.
